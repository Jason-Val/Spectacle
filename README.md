# Uplanner -- A UMass Course Planner

Written because Spire is inadequate for course planning, and other schools have better solutions.

## Issues With Spire:

- You can't graphically view your schedule in until your enrollment date comes and all classes are actually added and finalized
- You can't integrate your work schedule
- You can't make and compare multiple schedules
- You can't press "back" or reload the page
- Indication of conflicts is confusing and happens at the last minute during enrollment
- Searching is cumbersome

## Uplanner features:

- Everything happens on one page; view your schedule and search for/add classes at the same time
- You can add custom events, like work
- You can make multiple schedules
- It behaves like a normal website; no form resubmission issues
- Indication of conflicts is clear, immediate, and informative
- Search filters are easy and compact

## Our Tech Stack:

- Django
- Heroku
- Boostrap
- Postgres
- Dhtmlx Scheduler
